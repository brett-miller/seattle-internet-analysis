Notes from meeting with Bruce Blood and Tony Perez @ City of Seattle Offices on Feb 11, 2015 

* Existing Maps
  * State map 
  * From Will Saunders - used to run broadband office
    * Now runs open data at Washington State office
  * City's goal: Equal, Affordable, Symetrical (up/down) Gigabit Internet
    * Focus on residential / small businesses
  * Chattanooga, TN is a good example to look at

** Internet in Seattle

|Wireless Carriers|| not currently in scope|

** Regulation

  * Telco regulated by Washington State
  * Cable is regulated by the city (Tony's office)
  * On Feb 26th, it is likely that broadband as Title 2 Common Carrier
  		* No bid discrimination
		* Will likely have loophools for peering

** Plan

  * Map seattle's internet infrastructure using traceroutes and the resources listed below.
  * Find a way to measure family and small businesss internet service levels.
  * Create a speed test page and ask residents to test their service.
  * Use permit data from the City of Seattle to map investments.
  * Will provide data regarding what providers offer (price / speed).

** 	Technology

  Cable
  	Shared medium
  DSL
	Central Office (CO) -> POP -> Twisted Copper (TC) (limit of 2,400ft)
	Upgrade model to shorten TC: 
		CO -> POP -> Cross Connect -> TC
  	Some parts of town have 1.5 MB down / 300k up via DSL

** Data

* Dimensions:
  * Location
  * Service provider
  * Service description

* Measures:
  * Price
  * Advertized speed (up / down)
  * Objserved speed (up / down)
  * Time of day

* City Data
  * node locations can be obtained
  * Permits might not be in digital format due to backlog

** Ideas

 * Create heat map showing decreased speeds from POP
 * Use path-ping method to get initial speed 
 * Speed Test Page
  * Result of speed test could show their performance vs others in their area
  * Might increase bandwidth on network seattle routers
  * The city hosts videos - maybe could use their data around connection speeds from users
  * Web site is .Net
  * Could leverage a Socrata Form? (ask Chris Metcalf)
